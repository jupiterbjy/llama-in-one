## Q

I want to generate test for navigation, not the code.

Imagine 10x10 grid where coordinate ranges from (1, 1) to (10, 10).

Pick random starting points & destination points in grid,
output in following format: `(start_x, start_y) -> (end_x, end_y)` for 32 times total with newline on every 4 lines.

## A

```
(3, 7) -> (9, 2)
(8, 1) -> (5, 6)
(1, 5) -> (7, 9)
(6, 3) -> (2, 8)
(2, 2) -> (10, 6)
(9, 9) -> (4, 4)
(5, 10) -> (8, 3)
(4, 6) -> (1, 2)

(7, 8) -> (3, 5)
(10, 4) -> (6, 1)
(2, 9) -> (9, 6)
(8, 7) -> (5, 3)
(1, 1) -> (10, 10)
(6, 6) -> (3, 3)
(9, 2) -> (4, 9)
(3, 4) -> (8, 10)

(5, 7) -> (2, 3)
(10, 9) -> (7, 4)
(4, 2) -> (1, 8)
(7, 3) -> (10, 1)
(2, 6) -> (9, 8)
(8, 5) -> (3, 1)
(1, 3) -> (6, 7)
(6, 9) -> (2, 5)

(9, 6) -> (5, 2)
(3, 1) -> (8, 8)
(1, 9) -> (7, 5)
(5, 4) -> (2, 1)
(8, 3) -> (4, 10)
(2, 4) -> (9, 1)
(6, 2) -> (3, 9)
(7, 5) -> (4, 8)
```

I didn't know it was THIS hard to make it output 32 times, it keeps generating only 16.

Still did wrong on newline insertion.

fa using this with some 0 movement as trap.
